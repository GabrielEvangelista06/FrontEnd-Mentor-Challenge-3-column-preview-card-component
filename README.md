## My process

I starded this project making a semantic HTML, and after making a structured HTML I started to make a beatifull and organize CSS, according the HTML.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was the first I did alone, without help and I'm so pround of this. I learned how to make a simple website, but very beatiful, with a semantic HTML and a good basic CSS.

```css
.botao {
  border: none;
  border-radius: 2rem;
  font-family: 'Lexend Deca', sans-serif;
  font-size: 15px;
  margin-top: 3rem;
  padding: 0.8rem 1.5rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I tried to do a part of this challenge with the CSS grid, but I couldn't, I kept learning so that in the next challenge I can use this property.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox CSS](https://www.alura.com.br/artigos/css-guia-do-flexbox) -
  This helped me to understand the flexbox. I really liked this artic and will use it going forward.
